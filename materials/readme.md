## Project Description
The Hugo Schuchardt Archive provides insight into the life and work of the linguist Hugo Schuchardt (1842-1927) as well as into the scientific landscape of the time. The online presentation provides all primary works as well as an extensive secondary bibliography. Particular attention is on the edition of the correspondence, which is not only available as a facsimile but to a substantial extent already as commented full text, and has also been tagged with the help of a thesaurus.
