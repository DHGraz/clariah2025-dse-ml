## Project Description
The Hugo Schuchardt Archive provides insight into the life and work of the linguist Hugo Schuchardt (1842-1927) as well as into the scientific landscape of the time. The online presentation provides all primary works as well as an extensive secondary bibliography. Particular attention is on the edition of the correspondence, which is not only available as a facsimile but to a substantial extent already as commented full text, and has also been tagged with the help of a thesaurus.

## Project Description
The CLARIN ERIC flagship project ParlaMint enables transnational and multidisciplinary analyses of parliamentary debates across 29 countries and autonomous regions in Europe. The brief description is from the ParlaMint website: https://www.clarin.eu/parlamint

## ParlaMint Dataset in this Repository
A very small subset of the ParlaMint data—the English translations of Icelandic and Italian debates from 2022—was transformed into a TSV file and used for exercises with BERTopic during the school. The data was transformed from the XML-Version of the ParlaMint corpus.
